A previous post described the i3 tiling window manager and some brief set up details.<br />I will go a little further in to my set up here:<br /><br />When i3 is setup initially, the user is invited to set her mod key, to be either the alt key or the windows key. The default is the windows key, but I prefer the alt key, as it is easier on my hands/fingers. The mod key is what you use in conjunction with other keys, to use i3.<br />Once the mod key is selected, i3 generates a config file. It lives at:<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><b>~/.config/i3/config</b></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div>
