I don't really know why I went for the Z Shell to begin with. Well, thats not quite true, I saw everybody else was doing it and it looks like its kindof in vogue righ now, which is a stupid reason of course. It appears to be way more customizeable that bash also, especially with the community driven "Oh my zsh"<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b>https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</b></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Anyway, I kind of went what is the point? I'm not really going to get any benefit from it. My old two line Bash prompt&nbsp;<b> </b>with the present working directory on top and a simple large right pointing arrow on the bottom, with git repo status if appropriate, did me just fine.<br />My dotfiles can be viewed here:<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><b>https://github.com/eamoc/dotfiles.git&nbsp;</b></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"></div></div>
