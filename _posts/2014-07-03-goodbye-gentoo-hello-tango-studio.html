Yep, I finally said farewell to my beloved Gentoo. i really enjoyed working with it, and the Portage System. I was all set to dive in and explore Linux at a lower level, but configuring it for audio/studio recording was just too much of a headache. Jack2 - PulseAudio, its a mess to configure.<br />So I made the jump to Tango Studio. I have used Ubuntu before, and Ubuntu Studio, but I'm just not that fond of it, it kind of breaks the open source philosophy.<br />Tango is based on Debian, which ios a bit more "pure".<br />I'll report on its uses in due course!
