First the Portage Tree needs to be updated:<br /><b>emerge --sync</b><br /><br />Then portage can search for and apply updates to any installed programs:<br /><b>emerge --update --ask @world</b><br /><br />This command will not look for updates to any dependencies that were installed by any of the installed programs.<br />For this use the <b>deep</b> keyword:<br /><b>emerge --update --deep @world</b><br /><br />This will not look for updates to any <i>build dependencies</i>. I.e. packages that were needed for the compile and build stage of other packages.<br />To include these, and to ensure any USE flag changes are taken into account, run:<br /><b>emerge --update --deep --with-bdeps=y --newuse @world</b><br /><br />This is basically a FULL update to the system.<br /><br />Now check for obsolete dependencies:<br /><b>emerge --depclean</b><br /><br />Finally rebuild the applications that were dynamically linked to the now-removed software titles but don't require them anymore:<br /><b>revdep-rebuild</b><br /><br />
