So I migrated over to Tango Studio from Gentoo. This seemed like a good idea because Debian is uncrashable basically, but of course it doesn't necessarily come with the latest versions certain files and libraries.<br />This is a problem when I tried to install Bitwig Studio, the first decent DAW I have come across that is installable on Linux.<br />Trying to run it throws an error:<br /><br /><b>/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.14' not found (required by /usr/bin/bitwig-studio)</b><br /><br />This is because Debian only has version 2.13. After several attempts to install a later version of libc, I gave up. i fell in to dependency hell, and eventually my machine just wouldn't work. So I have capitulated and installed UbuntuStudio.<br />Despite my misgivings about it, It is so much easier to use, and, most importantly had the sound stack nicely configured. This is a MARE to sort out yourself.<br />Bitwig installed without a hitch.<br /><br /><br /><br />
