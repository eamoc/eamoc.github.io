<br /><br />Parentheses () are evaulated first, and if they are nested, the inner most pair is evaluated first.<br />NOTE: If we have an expression that contain two sets of parentheses that are on the same level, the C++ Standard does not specify the order in which these parenthesized subexporessions are evaluated.<br />Next come Multiplication, division and Modulus, * / %. If there is more than one operator in the expression, then they are evaluated from left to right.<br />Then there are the stream insertion and extraction operators << and >>, these are also evaluated from left to right. <br />The relational operators <, <=, >, >== are next, and they too are evaluated from left to right.<br />These are followed by the equality operators == and !=, which are evaluated left to right.<br />Finally we have the assignment operator =, which unlike the foregoing, is evaluated  from right to left.<br /><br /><br />
